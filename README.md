# Python-Easy

As a Python entry level enthusiast, my primary focus is on personal growth. So I decided to make 3 proyecto of each level difficulty:

#DIFFICULTY: EASY#

Simple Calculator: A calculator that can perform basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.


Cartoonizer: A Python project using OpenCV to convert regular images into cartoon-style illustrations. It employs techniques like adaptive thresholding and bilateral filtering, offering users a quick and artistic way to transform photos into visually appealing cartoons.

Task List: It involves the ability to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete underscores my commitment to organization and productivity in a daily life.

Password Generator: It is a random password generator that, using letters, digits, punctuation, and Umlaut, can withstand cyber threats, making it difficult for others to guess your password.
